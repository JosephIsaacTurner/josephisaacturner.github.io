## Timegiver

**Before Time**

Primordially, everything already existed at once. It was chaos. We were all there, however. 
We recognized that we needed structure, so we decided to let one of us order things. We trusted he would find a way to make things fit together and tell our story. We hoped he would take our input into consideration.




**The Nature of Time**

There are two illusions of time that I find interesting. The first illusion is that there is an intrinsic, absolute directionality to time flow. The second illusion is that we perceive time as divided up into past, present, and future, 
but from a physical perspective we can't really divide things up so cleanly. I suspect that untangling these illusions 
will offer insights into the nature of consciousness, intelligence, and free will.


1. The direction in which time flows is not absolute.
    - We could say the big bang was the beginning, but it could also be the end.
    - "Laplace's Demon" could predict the future and the past with equal precision
    - The equations that describe physical processes can just as easily be rewritten in the inverse
2. However, our experience is that time flows in one direction.
3. The one physical process that appears to correspond to an absolute direction of time is entropy change. 
4. Entropy always increases in same direction of time that we perceive time to flow.
5. This is evidence to suspect that our perception/consciousness might be related to entropy change. 
6. I believe intelligence is the highest pinnacle of biological organization that essentially resists entropy.
7. Resisting entropy is *difficult*-- that's why it requires intelligence. 
8. Intelligence at its most basic level is the capacity to resist entropy.
9. But entropy change is also kind of in the eye of the beholder.
    - We perceive a shuffled deck of cards as more "disordered" than a deck sorted by suite/number. 
    - However, any possible arrangement of cards is equally likely-- no given arrangement is objectively more "ordered" than any other.
    - It's something like, if we can identify rules that make a given arrangement simpler to represent, as time progresses, those rules will begin to fail. 
    - Intelligence is that which seeks to identify and implement simplifying rules, and its always an uphill battle because these rules will always fall short.
    - Resisting entropy = discovery organizing rules = intelligence
    - Even molecules can be intelligent. Cells are certainly extremely intelligent. And levels of intelligence hierarchically emerge even in humans-- we are teeming hubs of intelligence from the micro all the way to the macro.
    - The principle of life is to outlast the onslaught of disorder.
    - Encryption-- an encrypted message only has information so long as both the sender and receiver agree on how it encrypt/decrypt it.
    - Another way to think about entropy change is the tendency for high-density configurations to give way to configurations where mass-energy is distributed more homogenously. 
    - We can infer organization from heterogeneity. 
    - Intelligence exists in opposition to disorder
    - Intelligence exists in opposition to homogeneity
    - Intelligence is related to individuality.
    - Intelligence is cooperative
    - Entropy could just be that the net balance of dissipative and attractive forces leans toward dissipation
10. Is intelligence downstream from entropy, or entropy downstream from intelligence?

**Quantum mechanics can't save free will**

**What if you were the center of the universe?**

Sounds pretty egotistical, but let's think about it. I don't mean "center" in terms of space, but in terms of time. What if you are the origin point of all of the universe, the "singularity" the set off two twin domino lines that inevitably lead toward the big bang (although in this direction its a big crunch) in one direction and the heat death of the universe in the other? How would this affect your understanding of free will? The arrow of time emanates from you in all directions.

Camus said that we must imagine sysyphus as being happy. I say we must imagine that we are at each moment the origin points of everything that comes before and after.
